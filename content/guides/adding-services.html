<h1>Adding Services</h1>

<p>If you intend to use a definition only once, you can consider
using the <%= html_to('custom','/keyword/service/custom') %> service.</p>

<p>This
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">
Wikipedia list of ports</a> and this
<a href="http://www.graffiti.com/services">list of port names and numbers</a>
may be useful when defining your own services.
</p>

<h2>Simple Service</h2>

<p>
To define new services you add the appropriate entries before using them
later in the configuration file.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider a service named "daftnet" that listens at two ports,
port 1234 TCP and 1234 UDP where the expected client ports are the default
ports a system may choose plus the same port numbers the server listens at,
with further dynamic ports for which we have some kernel modules which
will do the tracking:</p>

<%= include_example('adding-services-01') %>

<p>Even though multiple ports are used in both directions, this is
still a simple service. FireHOL determines all of the combinations
of client and server ports and generates multiple iptables statements
to match them.</p>

<h3>Required entries</h3>

<p>The following are required for all simple services:</p>

<pre class="programlisting"><code>
server_<em>myservice</em>_ports="<em>proto</em>/<em>sports</em>"
client_<em>myservice</em>_ports="<em>cports</em>"
</code></pre>

<p><em>myservice</em> is the name we will give our
service.</p>
    
<p><em>proto</em> is anything that
<code class="command">iptables</code> accepts as a protocol e.g.
"tcp", "udp", "icmp" and numeric protocol values.</p>

<p><em>sports</em> is the ports the server is listening at.
It is a space-separated list of port numbers, names and ranges (from:to).
The keyword <em>any</em> will match any server port.</p>

<p><em>cports</em> is the ports the client may use to
initiate a connection. It is a space-separated list of port numbers,
names and ranges (from:to). The keyword <em>any</em>
will match any client port. The keyword <em>default</em>
will match default client ports.</p>

<p>For the local machine (e.g. a client within an interface) the default
client ports resolve to sysctl variable net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
(or <code class="filename">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</code>).</p>

<p>For a remote machine (e.g. a client within an interface or anything in
a router) the default client ports resolve to the variable
<code class="var">DEFAULT_CLIENT_PORTS</code>. For more information
see <%= html_to('Control_Variables','/keyword/manref/firehol/variables-control') %>
in the manual.</p>

<h3>Optional entries</h3>

<p>The following entries are optional. They are only needed if a
kernel module must be loaded to help track connections (typically
because the protocol uses dynamic ports):</p>

<pre class="programlisting"><code>
require_<em>myservice</em>_modules="<em>modules</em>"
require_<em>myservice</em>_nat_modules="<em>nat-modules</em>"
</code></pre>
    
<p>The named kernel modules will be loaded when the definition is used.
The NAT modules will only be loaded if <code class="var">FIREHOL_NAT</code>
is non-zero
(see <%= html_to('Control_Variables','/keyword/manref/firehol/variables-control') %>).</p>

<h2>Complex Service</h2>

<p>To create more complex rules, or stateless rules, you will need to
create a bash function prefixed rules_ e.g.
rules_<code class="var">myservice</code>.
The best reference is the many such functions in the main firehol
script.</p>

<h2>Adding your service to "all"</h2>

<p>When adding a service with a custom function or which uses modules, you
may also wish to include the following:</p>

<pre class="programlisting"><code>
ALL_SHOULD_ALSO_RUN="${ALL_SHOULD_ALSO_RUN} <code class="var">myservice</code>"
</code></pre>

<p>
which will ensure your service is set-up correctly as part of the all service.
There is no need to do this with simple services which do not load modules.
</p>

<h2>Creating your service in a separate file</h2>

<p>To allow definitions to be shared you can create files and
install them in the <code class="filename">/etc/firehol/services</code>
directory with a <code class="filename">.conf</code> extension.</p>

<p>The first line must read:</p>

<pre class="programlisting"><code>
#FHVER: 1:213
</code></pre>

<p>1 is the service definition API version. It will be changed if the API
is ever modified. The 213 originally referred to a FireHOL 1.x minor
version but is no longer checked.</p>

<p>FireHOL will refuse to run if the API version does not match the
expected one.</p>
