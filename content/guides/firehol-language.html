<h1>Advanced Language Features</h1>

<p><%= html_to('FireHOL_configuration_files','/keyword/manref/firehol/config-file') %>
are normal <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a>
scripts.  As such, you can use all
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a> features
within FireHOL configuration files, including functions, loops, variables,
I/O, etc.</p>

<p>Bash is used as the base configuration language for FireHOL since it is
the common denominator for a language that all UNIX system administrators
and developers should know and understand.</p>

<p>The fact that FireHOL uses Bash for its configuration, allows development
of add-ons and enables FireHOL to use programs to access SQL databases,
directory structures, DBM or other files, web front ends or other means
for the rules of the firewall.</p>

<h2>What to avoid</h2>

<p>The only <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a>
commands a FireHOL configuration should never use are
<span class="important">trap</span>
and <span class="important">exit</span>.</p>

<p>Traps are used by FireHOL for cleaning up all temporary files, and
possibly restoring the previously running firewall in case FireHOL
execution breaks, and the exit command will not just exit the configuration
file, it will exit FireHOL. FireHOL has disabled these features by default,
so that you will not be able to use them, unless you specifically enable
them.</p>

<p>Since a FireHOL configuration script runs inline with FireHOL, all
variables and function names defined within the configuration file
overwrite the ones defined by FireHOL so you should avoid some names.</p>

<p>Avoid using variables that start with
<span class="important">FIREHOL_</span>,
<span class="important">work_</span>, <span class="important">server_</span>,
and <span class="important">client_</span> as many such variables are used
by FireHOL internally.</p>

<p>There are also a number of functions names you
should avoid, but there is no generic pattern at the moment. I suggest
you should avoid defining functions with the names of FireHOL commands
(interface, router, client, server, etc) and functions starting
with <span class="important">rules_</span>.</p>

<p>Note however that you may wish to overwrite a few variables and
functions if you want to modify FireHOL services. See the
<a href="/guides/adding-services/">Adding Services</a> guide for details.</p>

<h2>Learning Bash</h2>

<p>To learn <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a>
scripting I suggest the following documents:
