<h1>Getting Help</h1>

<p>If you need help setting up or running FireHOL, the best thing to do
is join the
<a href="http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support">support
 mailing list</a> where you can get help from the authors and other experienced
users of FireHOL.</p>

<p>The list has a
 <a href="http://lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol-support/">searchable
support archive</a> which you can use to check to see if your question has been
answered before.</p>

<p>We will also try to help you if you create an entry tagged <b>help</b>
in the
<a href="https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/issues">FireHOL issue tracker</a>
on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
