title: FireHOL v3.1.0 Released
---

This version reworks installation to make full use of autoconf results in all
programs.

FireHOL deprecates service ipv6error, not needed since 3.0.0 and moved ICMPv6
RELATED matching earlier to stop user accidentally preventing them.

VNetBuild has improved graphviz output.
