title: FireHOL R5 v1.273 released
---
<p>Updated to parse the latest format of the IANA reservations page.</p>

<p>Added support for custom actions for services. This opens a way for
allowing actions that can be controlled externally without restarting the
firewall.</p>

<p>Fixed several minor issues (better NAT support for all services, handling
for external pager command, kernel config parsing, config wizard, etc).</p>
