title: FireHOL 2.0.2 and 3.0.0-rc.2
---

FireHOL 2.0.2 and 3.0.0-rc.2 have been released.

For people who are differentiating ipv4 and ipv6 at the interface or
router level these have an important fix. Without it, one ip version of
your firewall will not accept RELATED traffic or log dropped packets.

People who only use `interface` and `router` to do both simultaneously
are not affected, even if they differentiate individual helper and/or
service rules. Those who produce an IPv4 or IPv6 only firewall will
not be affected either.

FireHOL 3.0.0-rc.2 contains even more improvements including synproxy
support and load-balacing NAT. Please help test it by checking that
the output it generates for your current configuration is still correct
and report any problems you find.
