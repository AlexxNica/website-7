title: FireHOL R5 v1.273 released
---

Updated to parse the latest format of the IANA reservations page.

Added support for custom actions for services. This opens a way for
allowing actions that can be controlled externally without restarting
the firewall.

Fixed several minor issues (better NAT support for all services,
handling for external pager command, kernel config parsing, config
wizard, etc).
