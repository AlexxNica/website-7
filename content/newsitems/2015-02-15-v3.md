title: FireHOL 2.0.1 and 3.0.0-rc.1
---

FireHOL 2.0.1 has been released. This version fixes a bug where a custom
`iptables -I` command is lost.

At the same time, FireHOL 3.0.0-rc.1 is now available. This version
contains many improvements over the 2.x series including more features,
faster operation and optimised output.  See:

*   [This post](http://lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol-devs/2015-February/000438.html)
    for some details on recent changes.
*   The [traps and
    knocks](https://github.com/firehol/firehol/wiki/Working-with-traps)
    Wiki page for simple IDS and knocking configurations without daemons
*   The [marks](https://github.com/firehol/firehol/wiki/Working-with-MARKs)
    Wiki page for information on the new handling of marks. FireHOL now
    allows you to define multiple mark ranges with different behaviours and
    will take care of the details of making them work with the single
    kernel mark.

Please help test 3.0.0-rc.1 by checking that the output it generates
for your current configuration is still correct and report any problems
you find.

If you are upgrading from version 1.x, please see the [upgrade
notes](/upgrade/#config-version-6).
