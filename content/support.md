Support
=======

These are some ways you can get help and support to install and set up
FireHOL

Mailing List
------------

If you are a user of FireHOL, the best thing you can do is join the
[support mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support). New
release and security announcements will be made to this list and you can
get help from the authors and other experienced users of FireHOL.

You can read and search the list at
[GMane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.firehol.user)
to check to see if your question has been answered before.

Issue tracker
-------------

If you think you've found a bug, the [FireHOL issue
tracker](https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/issues) is the best place to
report it.

If you create an entry tagged **help**, we will also try to help you on
more general topics.
