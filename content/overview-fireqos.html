<h2>What is FireQOS?</h2>

<p>FireQOS is... traffic shaping made easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    FireQOS is a traffic shaping helper. It has a very
    simple shell scripting language to express traffic shaping.
    You run FireQOS to setup the kernel commands. You can also
    run it to get status information or dump the traffic of a
    class. FireQOS is not a daemon and does not need to run
    always to apply traffic shaping.
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS applies traffic shaping on the output of any
    interface.
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS applies traffic shaping on the input of any
    interface. Shaping incoming traffic is classfull, i.e. you
    have all the control available, similar to outgoing
    traffic. This is accomplished by setting up IFB devices.
    FireQOS handles everything about IFB devices. Any kernel
    that supports them will do.
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS supports overheads calculation. This means it
    can perfectly shape incoming and outgoing traffic on a
    linux box behind an ADSL router, or on a linux box with an
    ADSL modem attached. ATM overheads will be calculated based
    on the DSL encapsulation.
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Each interface can
    be defined as ipv4, ipv6 or both (ipv4 and ipv6 in
    parallel).
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS supports nested classes. Nested classes can
    either be direct (child classes are directly attached to
    their parent class), or hardware emulation (child classes
    are attached to a qdisc with linklayer parameters and
    overheads calculation, which is attached to a parent class).
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS calculates port range masks (you just give a
    port range, FireQOS finds the optimal combination of tc
    statements to accomplish the match).
  </li>

  <li>
    Virtually any number of interfaces, any number of
    classes and any number of classification rules can be
    configured (the way it is organized it can configure up to
    5000 classes per interface).
  </li>

  <li>
    It classifies packets using tc (both ipv4 and ipv6),
    but you can also use iptables CLASSIFY targets, or MARKs.
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://luxik.cdi.cz/%7Edevik/qos/htb/manual/userg.htm" >HTB</a>
    is used for all classes.
  </li>

  <li>
    FireQOS allows you to tcpdump the traffic of any leaf
    class. This allows you to examine the traffic you have
    assigned to classes.
  </li>
</ul>
