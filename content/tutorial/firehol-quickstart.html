<h1>FireHOL QuickStart</h1>

<p>First, <a href="/installing/">install the software</a>.</p>

<p>
To gain a greater understanding and for step-by-step help building a
custom firewall, see the other <a href="/tutorial">tutorials</a>.
To have FireHOL guess the configuration for your machine, simply run:
</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
firehol helpme &gt; /tmp/firehol.conf
</pre>

<p>
The purpose of the <%= fh_manref('firehol','helpme') %> feature is to give
you a configuration file that you can modify to get an operational firewall
quickly, especially if your firewalling and iptables knowledge is limited.
This feature does not stop or alter the running firewall of your machine.

The output file <span class="important">must</span> be edited before you
use it, following the embedded instructions.
