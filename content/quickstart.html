<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>
First install the software, either from
your <a href="/packages/">distribution</a>,
from a <a href="/installing/">tar-file</a>
or from the <a href="/source-install/">git repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>FireHOL</h2>

<p>
To gain a greater understanding and for step-by-step help building a
custom firewall, see the <a href="/tutorial">tutorials</a>.
To have FireHOL guess the configuration for your machine, simply run:
</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
firehol helpme &gt; /tmp/firehol.conf
</pre>

<p>
The purpose of the <%= fh_manref('firehol','helpme') %> feature is to give
you a configuration file that you can modify to get an operational firewall
quickly, especially if your firewalling and iptables knowledge is limited.
This feature does not stop or alter the running firewall of your machine.
</p>

<p>
The output file <span class="important">must</span> be edited before you
use it, following the embedded instructions.
</p>

<h2>FireQOS</h2>

<p>
FireQOS does not have any mechanism to automatically detect and classify
your traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#qos-newuser">This FireQOS tutorial</a> is a step by step guide
for setting up traffic control on a system. The steps followed will
allow you to apply QoS without disrupting your current service or traffic
or set up traffic monitoring without traffic shaping.
