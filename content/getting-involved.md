Getting Involved
================

If you are an experienced user willing to help others, please join up to
the [support mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support) and
offer advice where you can.

Help on the project will be welcomed in any area - development, testing,
infrastructure, documentation, web design or anywhere else you have the
time and inclination to offer it.

Please consider introducing yourself on the [development mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-devs)
([archive](http://lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol-devs/)).
Alternatively drop an existing project member an [email](/email/).

Or, just fork the [repository](https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol) and
get coding. See the [source install instructions](/source-install/).
