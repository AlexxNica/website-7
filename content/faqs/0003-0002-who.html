Well, don't trust me. I don't want you to do so and you are not supposed
to do so. I have made the most to make it possible for you to audit the
generated firewall. You have the
<%= fh_manref('firehol-opt-explain','explain&nbsp;feature') %>
where FireHOL interactively produces iptables statements for the
configuration directives you enter, the
<%= fh_manref('firehol-opt-debug','debug&nbsp;feature') %>
where FireHOL produces all the iptables statements for the entire
configuration for you to examine, and extensive automatically generated
documentation for all the
<a href="/services/">services</a> supported. 
</p>

<p>
Don't trust me. You are supposed to audit FireHOL output at least once,
and if you agree, trust <span class="important">it</span>, not me.
