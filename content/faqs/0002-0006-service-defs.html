title: 0006-Why I cannot use the service definitions in helpers?
kind: faq

<p>
As you have noted, the <a href="/services/">service definitions</a>
cannot be used in helper statements (mainly NAT).
The reason is that currently FireHOL's core logic is limited to one
iptables table (filter). To extend this to all iptables tables a new
core logic is needed that should be based on something that can be
shared across all iptables tables. The only such thing today is MARKs.
MARKs are also used for QoS unifying all major traffic management applications.
</p>

<p>
I have made a few experiments with MARKs but I stuck because there are
bugs in the iptables logic when using MARKs. These bugs exist in most
kernels distributed today with the main Linux distributions.
