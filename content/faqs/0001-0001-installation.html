<p>
Many Linux distributions carry FireHOL as a
<a href="/packages/">standard package</a>.
To get a more up to date version (e.g. with FireQOS), choose one of
the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download an official release or pre-release from the
  <a href="http://firehol.org/download/releases/">release download area</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Download a stable but unreleased daily build from the
  <a href="http://firehol.org/download/unsigned/master/">daily build area</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Read about installing
  <a href="/faq/#faq-0001-0002">straight from the Git repository</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Wherever you get FireHOL from you can copy and/or use the
<span class="filename">sbin/firehol.in</span> and
<span class="filename">sbin/fireqos.in</span> files directly.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to install FireHOL with the canonical GNU invocation:
</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
  ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
FireHOL detects at runtime if the remaining of the commands it needs to run
are installed. In general the requirements are not onerous, just some
common shell and networking commands which come as standard with modern
Linux distributions.

The Wiki has a
<a href="https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/Dependencies">complete list of
dependencies</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/download/releases">Official releases</a> show a version
in the form <span class="important">2.0.0-pre1</span>.
<a href="/download/unsigned/master">Daily builds</a> show a
version like this: <span class="important">commit-f9d5175</span>.
