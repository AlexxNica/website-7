<p>
Installation is either via your distribution's
<a href="/packages/">standard package</a> mechanism or via one of the
<a href="http://firehol.org/download/releases/">tar file releases</a>.
For the latter, once unpacked, the canonical GNU invocation will install
FireHOL:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
<p>Or you can just copy and use the
<span class="filename">sbin/firehol.in</span> file directly.</p>

<p>
The main requirements are that you be running a Linux kernel with
netfilter and have the iptables (for IPv4) and ip6tables (for IPv6)
userspace installed. These come as standard with all modern distributions.
</p>

<p>
FireHOL detects at runtime if the remaining of the commands it needs to run
are installed. In general the requirements are not onerous, just some
common shell and networking commands which generally come as part of
a default installation. The Wiki has a
<a href="https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/Dependencies">complete list of
dependencies</a>.
