<p>
To get a listing of the actions FireHOL would take based on your
configuration, you can run:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
firehol debug
</pre>

<p>
In the event of an unexpected problem, FireHOL will leave behind its
temporary files (and let you know where they are located) in order to
help you diagnose the problem.
</p>

<p>
FireHOL runs as a bash script so if you need detailed information about
what is going on internally you can add these lines to your configuration:
<pre class="programlisting">
set -x
set -v
</pre>
</p>
