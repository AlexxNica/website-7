FireHOL and FireQOS share a common version number. Release numbers used
follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme (daily builds
not).

Thus releases will be 3 digits e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
3.0.0
~~~~

Pre-release versions will have an additional identifier e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
3.0.0-rc.5
~~~~

Git checkouts and daily builds add a branch id to what will be the
next release e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
3.0.0_master
~~~~

The `_whatever` indicates the version is **prior** to even the
`-rc.nn` versions.


Oldler versions
:   Older daily builds used the commit id from which they were built:

    ~~~~ {.programoutput}
    $ sudo ./sbin/firehol
    FireHOL commit-61d70a2
    ~~~~

    When checked out from git, the programs will report internal version
    numbers e.g.:

    ~~~~ {.programoutput}
    $ ./sbin/firehol.in
    FireHOL $Id: 8c6fd57f0b7a3c76fe848dc118f0637cb853f1e4 $
    ~~~~

    Version 1 packages were in the form 1.xxx, which related to the CVS
    revision of the FireHOL script.
