FireHOL and FireQOS share a common version number. The numbers used
follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme.

Thus releases will be 3 digits e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
2.0.0
~~~~

Pre-release versions will have an additional identifier e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
2.0.0-rc.5
~~~~

Daily builds use the commit id from which they were built:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
$ sudo ./sbin/firehol
FireHOL commit-61d70a2
~~~~

When checked out from git, the programs will report internal version
numbers e.g.:

~~~~ {.programoutput}
$ ./sbin/firehol.in
FireHOL $Id: 8c6fd57f0b7a3c76fe848dc118f0637cb853f1e4 $
~~~~

Earlier packages were in the form 1.xxx, which related to the CVS
revision of the FireHOL script. Nine pre-releases exist up to 2.0.0-pre9
which are limited by semantic versioning. The -rc.nnnn come after these.
