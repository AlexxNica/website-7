<p>
To get a configuration file quickly, you can run:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">firehol helpme</pre>
<p>
The <%= fh_manref('firehol-opt-helpme','helpme&nbsp;feature') %>
reads various system parameters of your system
and generates a configuration file especially for the host it runs.
Helpme is safe to use: it does not alter your running firewall, it does
not modify anything on your system.
</p>

<p>
In general, I will try to avoid helping you on manual configuring your
specific firewall; I commit however to making helpme detect correctly
every single case. I believe, this will benefit all the community,
not just you. 
</p>

<p>
In any case, I guess I have done a good job in designing FireHOL the way
you expect it to work, and that the documentation is helpful enough,
since all the support tools are pretty silent. Of course you are
welcome to ask anything you might need regarding FireHOL.
