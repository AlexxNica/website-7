<p>
FireHOL has been designed to be a startup service. Its exact location
depends on the distribution you are using. Most probably you will find
FireHOL in <code class="filename">/etc/init.d</code> and in RedHat systems
you can also access it with the <code class="command">service</code> command.
</p>

<p>
On Debian or Ubuntu, become root and modify
<code class="filename">/etc/default/firehol</code> to have
START_FIREHOL=YES, then, as root, start it with:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>/etc/init.d/firehol start</code></pre>

<p>To make it start automatically run:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>update-rc.d firehol defaults</code></pre>
