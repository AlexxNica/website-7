<p>
<code class="interface">eth0:1</code> is not really a virtual Ethernet
device. The <code class="interface">eth0:1</code> is just a naming
convention for tools such as ifconfig to be able to use multiple IP
addresses on a single interface.
</p>

<p>
If you have interfaces with these names, it is for the purpose of having
multiple IP addresses on an interface. Netfilter does not recognise the
aliases. You cannot use them in your firewall and must match on the IP
address instead.
</p>

<p>
In practice, iptables does not prevent you creating rules to try to
match <code class="interface">eth0:1</code>. However, when running,
the incoming packets will be seen as from <code class="interface">eth0</code>
and will match only the <code class="interface">eth0</code> rules. FireHOL
inherits this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Note that VLAN interfaces such as <code class="interface">eth0.1</code> are
genuine interfaces that will work as expected within firewall rules.
