Well, don't trust us. We don't want you to do so and you are not supposed
to do so. We have done the utmost to make it possible for you to audit
the generated firewall.

You have the <%=
html_to('explain_feature','/keyword/manref/firehol/explain') %> where
FireHOL interactively produces iptables statements for the configuration
directives you enter, the <%=
html_to('debug_feature','/keyword/manref/firehol/debug') %> where
FireHOL produces all the iptables statements for the entire
configuration for you to examine, and extensive automatically generated
documentation for all the [services](/services/) supported.

Ideally you should audit the results at least once to ensure you are
happy with the rules produced. The rules that get output are extremely
regular which should make the task fairly straightforward.

You should also read [When FireHOL Runs](/guides/when-firehol-runs/) in
order to understand how FireHOL gets its results.

Please consider signing up to the [support mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support) to
ensure you are kept informed in the event that a security problem is
discovered.

Overall it is your responsibility to ensure the final firewall produced
behaves as you want it to. If in doubt we recommend that you seek help
from a firewall/networking professional.
