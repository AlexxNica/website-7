FireHOL has been designed to be a startup service. Its exact location
depends on the distribution you are using. Most probably you will find
FireHOL in `/etc/init.d`{.filename} and in RedHat systems you can also
access it with the `service`{.command} command.

On Debian or Ubuntu, become root and modify
`/etc/default/firehol`{.filename} to have START\_FIREHOL=YES, then, as
root, start it with:

~~~~ {.programlisting}
/etc/init.d/firehol start
~~~~

To make it start automatically run:

~~~~ {.programlisting}
update-rc.d firehol defaults
~~~~
