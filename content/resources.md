==================

Bash Scripting
--------------

To learn [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html) scripting I
suggest the following documents:

-   [Advanced Bash-Scripting
    Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html)
-   [Bash Programming - Introduction
    HOW-TO](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)

Firewall Testing
----------------

To test your firewall there are a few software tools and a few online
services to help you. I suggest the following tools (of course you need
two computers to run the test):

-   [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) is probably the best open source
    security scanner available. \
    [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) not only checks the firewall of a
    host, but also scans for known application vulnerabilities. \
    I highly recommend [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) for periodic
    (weekly, monthly, etc) scans.
-   [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) ("Network Mapper") is an open source
    utility for network exploration or security auditing.

There are a number of sites that offer firewall testing services to
everyone:

-   [AuditMyPC](http://www.auditmypc.com/)
-   [Security Space](http://www.securityspace.com/sspace/index.html), a
    commercial service with a free scan. \
    These people are using something like
    [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) if not
    [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/) itself).
-   [Shields UP!!](https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2) NanoProbe
    Technology Internet Security Testing for... Windows Users. (note:
    well, it says for Windows, but it is a port scanner with a limited
    range of ports to be scanned...)

Other testers on the net:

-   [Smurf Amplifier Registry (SAR)](http://www.powertech.no/smurf/) The
    SAR is a tool for Internet administrators being attacked by or
    implicated in smurf attacks, or those who wish to take precautions.
