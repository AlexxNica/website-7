<li><a href="/manual/">Reference manual</a> for detailed information</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, we also have a <a href="/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a>

<h2>Important Security Notes</h2>

<p>FireHOL can be no more secure than your use of it.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="/faq/#trust">this FAQ</a>. You should audit the
results at least once to ensure you are happy with the rules produced.
The rules that get output are extremely regular which should make the
task fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>You should also read <a href="/guides/when-firehol-runs/">When FireHOL
Runs</a> in order to understand how FireHOL gets its results.</p>

<p>Please consider signing up to the
<a href="http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support">support
 mailing list</a> to ensure you are kept informed in the event that a
security problem is discovered.</p>

<p>Overall it is your responsibility to ensure the final firewall produced
behaves as you want it to. If in doubt we recommend that you seek help
from a firewall/networking professional.</p>
