Uses for FireHOL and FireQOS
============================

Almost every Linux firewall / traffic control need is covered, including:

* control of any number of internal/external/virtual interfaces
* control of any combination of routed traffic
* setting up DMZ routers and servers
* all kinds of NAT
* providing strong protection (flooding, spoofing, etc.)
* transparent caches
* source MAC verification
* blacklists, whitelists
* classification of traffic by source, destination and type
* provide bandwith guarantees and upper limits
* allow optional borrowing of unused bandwith
* live stats on traffic classification
