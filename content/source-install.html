<h1>Download the Source</h1>

<p>
You can download the source from GitHub using the links in the menu.
If you want to clone the repository, the basic <span class="command">git</span>
commands are below.
</p>

<p>
Note: if you do not want to run <span class="command">git</span> but are
just looking for the bleeding edge version, you can still use
the <a href="/installing">normal install instructions</a>: the
<a href="/download/unsigned/master">'daily build'</a> is actually
updated automatically whenever the master repository is changed,
within a few minutes.
</p>

<p>First time clone of a repository into directory
<span class="filename">firehol</span>:

<pre class="programlisting">
$ git clone https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol.git
