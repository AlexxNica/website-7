Documentation
=============

We have a variety of documentation for different users:

-   [Tutorials](/tutorial/) for new users
-   [Topical guides](/guides/) on firewalling and QOS
-   [Reference manual](/manual/) for detailed information
-   [FireHOL services list](/services/) for quick online access

Of course, we also have a [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq/) page and
there is a [FireHOL/FireQOS
Wiki](https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/) hosted at Github.

Important Security Notes
------------------------

FireHOL can be no more secure than your use of it.

Please read [this FAQ](/faq/#trust). You should audit the results at
least once to ensure you are happy with the rules produced. The rules
that get output are extremely regular which should make the task fairly
straightforward.

You should also read [When FireHOL Runs](/guides/when-firehol-runs/) in
order to understand how FireHOL gets its results.

Please consider signing up to the [support mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support) to
ensure you are kept informed in the event that a security problem is
discovered.

Overall it is your responsibility to ensure the final firewall produced
behaves as you want it to. If in doubt we recommend that you seek help
from a firewall/networking professional.
